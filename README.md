The landing features various sections with engaging visuals, including galleries, exhibition highlights, and informational blocks about the museum. Carefully applied CSS styles and hover effects enhance the visual presentation, making the page interactive and inviting. With a clean layout and intuitive navigation, the MET Landing page offers users an informative and visually rich experience that reflects the museum's cultural significance.
